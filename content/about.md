# About GDRIlab

We are interested in using a combination of multi-omics and classical genetics to investigate of the structural and functional genomics of oil crops such as rapeseed. We focus on gene cloning, function analysis, and molecular regulation network related to disease resistance, oil content, gametogenesis and male sterility, plant type and photosynthesis. The research is toward providing genes, methdology and theory for genetic improvement of oilseed crops.
